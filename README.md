The maternal brain presents remarkable neuroplasticity during pregnancy and the postpartum period, along with increased vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders like postpartum depression (PPD). To investigate this vulnerability further, I will analyze cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics data using the slide-tag and slide-seq methods.
A validated rodent model of PPD was used, where high levels of corticosterone (PD2) are administered across multiple timepoints (nulliparous, gestational day 20, postpartum day 8 and 23). Both Slide-seq and Slide-tags provide genome-wide expression profiles with varying spatial resolutions, allowing the identification of genetic trends at the cell type level. This information will be combined with the spatial location of the mRNA, revealing region-specific trends.
This project aims to create publicly available spatial maps of the rodent brain, illustrating genetic and spatial shifts related to immune signaling and neuroplasticity. Integrating two different methods will provide greater insight into the alterations that happen in the maternal brain and how they might be related to psychiatric pathology. My research will bring about findings on the interplay between female physiology and the brain, addressing a gap in neuroscience, where only 3% of studies focus on females.
